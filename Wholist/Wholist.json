  "Description": "A Wholist-derived session log for nearby players.\n\nFeatures:\n- User-initiated scan sessions that keep a \"seen this session\" list even as players load/unload.\n- Optional marking with local history (first marked, last seen, times seen) to reduce duplicate reporting.\n- Customizable clipboard export templates (names-only, names+world, full template blocks).\n- Lodestone helper: opens character search for name/world (no automatic lookups).\n- Local-only storage with configurable auto-prune (default: 180 days).\n\nGuardrails:\n- No automated reporting or ticket submission.\n- No in-game interaction automation (no tells/emotes/follow).\n- Scanning runs only when explicitly started by the user.\n\nNote: This plugin is limited to players currently loaded by your client at the time they are seen.",
